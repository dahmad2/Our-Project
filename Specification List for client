Requirement Specification – Bradford 
Metropolitan District Council Asset 
Mapping 
1. Project Overview 
This project aims to develop a web-based interface for the mapping and 
management of assets using Bradford’s spatial data. The system will allow 
users to upload datasets, interact with interactive maps, and manage 
assets dynamically. The system will be designed with security, 
accessibility, and usability in mind, ensuring a robust, user-friendly platform 
for all users. 
2. User Requirements 
2.1 User Registration & Authentication 
User Registration 
• Signup Process: Users must provide personal details, including: 
o Full Name: Required for identification. 
o Email Address: Used for notifications, including account 
approval/rejection, password resets, etc. 
o Password: Encrypted storage for security, ensuring minimum 
strength criteria (e.g., 8 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and 
symbols). 
o Address: Optional, but necessary for certain user role 
assignments or reporting. 
o Department: Ensures the user is assigned to the correct group, 
and helps with role-based access control. 
Email Confirmation 
• Upon registering, users will receive a confirmation email notifying 
them that their account application is under review. 
• Approval/Rejection Workflow: An admin will review applications. 
Users will receive a second email confirming whether their account has 
been approved or rejected. 
Password Reset 
• Password Reset Process: Both users and admins can reset passwords 
via a time-limited email link (expires in 15 minutes) for security. 
Account Suspension 
• Accounts can be temporarily suspended without deletion, which 
allows for restoring access after resolving issues (e.g., account misuse, 
password recovery). 
User Roles & Permissions 
• Admin Role: 
o Full access to manage users, permissions, and datasets. 
o Can assign roles, approve/reject users, and oversee overall data 
integrity. 
• Editor Role: 
o Can upload and manage asset data but has restricted access to 
user management and admin settings. 
• Viewer Role: 
o Has read-only access to view asset data. They cannot make 
modifications. 
2.2 Dataset Management 
Dataset Upload & Entry 
• Bulk Upload: Users (with appropriate permissions) can upload 
datasets in CSV format, which populate assets on the map. Datasets 
may include building information, asset locations, or relevant 
geospatial data. 
• Manual Data Entry: In cases where bulk uploads aren’t feasible, users 
can manually enter asset information, including location, asset type, 
etc. 
Data Validation 
• Required Columns: Certain essential columns (e.g., Longitude, 
Latitude, Asset Type) must be present in uploaded CSV files. 
• File Size Limits: The system enforces size limits (e.g., 50MB max per 
upload) to prevent performance issues. 
• Duplicate Detection: If assets are already present in the system (based 
on a combination of unique identifiers, such as coordinates), 
duplicates will be flagged. 
• Longitude/Latitude Validation: Automatically checks for accurate 
geographic coordinates to prevent incorrect or out-of-bound locations. 
Retention & Modification Logging 
• All dataset modifications, such as edits or deletions, will be logged for 
forensic tracking to ensure data integrity and enable auditing. 
2.3 Map Layers 
Layer Management 
• Core Layer (Council Buildings): Assets such as council-owned 
buildings will be imported from CSV files containing longitude and 
latitude data. 
• Additional Assets Layer: Users can manually add other assets, like 
parks, recreational spaces, or other assets managed by the council. 
Real-Time Updates 
• Changes to datasets are automatically reflected on the map in real
time, ensuring up-to-date information without the need for a page 
refresh. 
2.4 Accessibility Features 
The platform will adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
to ensure all users, regardless of ability, can effectively interact with the 
system. 
Features: 
• Alt Text for Images: Provides detailed descriptions of images for 
visually impaired users utilizing screen readers. 
• Keyboard Navigation: Full navigation and interaction with the site via 
keyboard shortcuts, providing an alternative to mouse use. 
• High Contrast & Readable Text: The platform will be designed with 
high contrast colors and easy-to-read fonts for better legibility. 
• Color Contrast Checks: Colors will be validated for accessibility, 
ensuring visibility for users with color blindness. 
• Captions & Transcripts: Text alternatives will be provided for video and 
audio content to assist users with hearing impairments. 
• Resizable Text: Users will have the ability to adjust text size without 
breaking the layout. 
• Clear Form Labels & Instructions: Forms will have properly defined 
labels and error messages to ensure accessibility for screen reader 
users. 
• Error Handling: Clear and concise error notifications will be provided 
when input is incorrect or incomplete. 
3. Admin Requirements 
3.1 User Management 
• Admin Controls: Admins can approve, reject, modify, suspend, or 
delete user accounts, and assign roles and departments. 
• Role-based Department Access: Users will be assigned departments, 
ensuring they only have access to data relevant to their assigned 
department. 
• User Roles: Admins will define user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) and 
ensure appropriate permissions are enforced. 
3.2 Dataset Management 
• Dataset Access Management: Admins can assign or revoke access to 
datasets using a tick-box system, streamlining permissions 
management. 
• Forensic Tracking: A full audit trail of dataset changes will be 
maintained for security and compliance, detailing who made changes 
and when. 
3.3 Security & Access Control 
• Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Optional but recommended for 
admins, requiring a second authentication factor for added security. 
• Data Encryption: All sensitive data, including passwords and datasets, 
will be encrypted to ensure data confidentiality. 
• Role-based Access Control: Access to features and datasets is based 
on the user’s role and department, enforcing a least privilege security 
model. 
3.4 Logging & Auditing 
• Audit Logs: The system will maintain logs for: 
o User Logins & Logouts: Track who accesses the system and 
when. 
o Dataset Modifications: Keep track of uploads, edits, and 
deletions. 
o System Integrations: Monitor external API or service calls for 
troubleshooting. 
• Log Retention: Admins can configure the retention period for logs, 
ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations. 
4. Technical Details 
4.1 Frontend 
• Framework: The system will be developed using React or Vue.js 
(decision pending based on team preference). 
• Mapping Library: Integration with Google Maps API or Leaflet.js for 
interactive maps, depending on the chosen frontend technology. 
4.2 Backend 
• Server-Side Language: The backend will be built using PHP, using 
frameworks like Laravel or CodeIgniter for scalability. 
• Database: A MySQL database with clustering or replication for high 
availability will store user and dataset data. 
4.3 Security 
• Password Encryption: All passwords will be securely hashed and 
salted. 
• Role-Based Access Control: Strict permission management ensures 
users only access necessary data. 
• Multi-Factor Authentication: As an added security feature for admins 
(optional but recommended). 
4.4 Branding

libraries and tools wherever possible to ensure cost-effectiveness. 
• Data Integrity: Forensic tracking mechanisms and error handling 
ensure data remains accurate and secure. 
6. Appendix 
• API Integrations: Google Maps API integration and other necessary 
external APIs for authentication or data retrieval.
